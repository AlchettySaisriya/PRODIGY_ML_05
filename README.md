üç≥ Calorie Estimator

This project is a web-based food calorie estimator that allows users to upload an image of food and receive an estimated calorie count. The interface is designed with a modern "glassmorphism" style.

Features

    Image Upload: Users can easily upload an image of a food item.

    Calorie Prediction: (Assumed backend functionality) The application processes the uploaded image to predict the food item and its approximate calorie content.

    Attractive UI: A clean and modern user interface using a glass-card design with a food-related background.

    Responsive Design: The layout is designed to be responsive, adapting to various screen sizes.

Technologies Used

    HTML5: For the basic structure of the web page.

    CSS3: For styling the application, including the glassmorphism effect and responsive design.

    Jinja2 (Templating): The {% if prediction %} and {{ prediction }} syntax suggests this project is likely integrated with a Python web framework like Flask or Django that uses Jinja2 for server-side rendering.

    Backend (Implied): A backend (e.g., Python with a machine learning model for image recognition and calorie estimation) is required to process the image and provide predictions.
